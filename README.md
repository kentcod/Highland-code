# Highland-code
This repository includes python and R code that reads in data from the Highland Invasive Plant Species Mapping Project, cleans data, performs visualizations, and performs machine learning techniques.

Augmented_Algorithms includes the data cleaning, testing, and optimization for different supervised learning techniques.

Compartment_Predict reads in data from the supervised dataset and the new dataset (unsurveyed polygons). Then, after training the already optimized algorithm on the entire supervised dataset, the MLP Classifier predicts overall invasion for compartments (polygons) in the new dataset.

Final_Project includes my final project for Advanced Biostats. This project performed multivariate analysis of all 21 invasive plant species encountered to determine community differences between within and outside of Riparian Buffer zones and attempted to reframe the prediction algorithm as a Generalized Linear Model instead of an MLP Classifier.
