# Overview

In the following code, I will examine what landscape features, if any, influence overall plant invasion. I hypothesize that numerous landscape features will have a significant impact on invasion as invasive species are known to prefer low stress and highly nutrient available environments like riparian environments or eutrophic environments near farmland. Overall, the goal of the subsequent analyses is to predict plant invasion based on any significant features. 

## Feasibility

56 total polygons were surveyed all at James Monroe Highland in Charlottesville, Virginia. Further, I recorded invasion by determining the presence of invasive plants from the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation's 2014 list of State Invasive Species. Thus, These data provide a viable opportunity to determine relationships between landscape features and overall plant invasion in Virginia, specifically the blue mountain region.

## Scope

The following code and analyses will determine which landscape features contribute to overall plant invasion while controlling for any random effects like riparian buffer presence, determined later on.

## Data Collection

In the growing season of 2023, the data were collected over about 50 hours and 5 separate trips to the Rustic Trail System at James Monroe Highland in 2023. The n = 56 polygons were drawn based on distance from streams. To obtain measures for plant invasion, a Braun-Blanket cover class system was used: 1: 0-5% invasion, 2: 5-25% invasion, 3: 25-50% invasion, 4: 50-75% invasion, 5: 75-100% invasion. That is, each of the 56 polygons was marked as a numerical value from 1-5 to denote the level of invasive species compared to native species. Further, measures of other features were determined by geoprocessing within ArcGIS Pro. For example, Albemarle County provided historic imagery that could be digitized into layers for farmland cover from 1937-1955, 1955-1974, and 1974-1996. Then, using the tabulate intersection tool in ArcGIS Pro, the percentage of historic farmland for each respective year range was determined for each polygon. Lastly, geoprocessing also determined distance measurements for distance from farmland, distance from riparian buffer, distance from floodplain, and elevation from floodplain.

## Important Variables

In this portion of the study, the response variable is the numeric level of plant invasion (2-5 in this case because no polygons had less than 5% invasion). The potential predictor variables include distance from farmland, distance from riparian buffer, distance from floodplain, elevation from floodplain, percentage of evergreen forest, and percentage of converted farmland for each of the three previously stated year ranges.

## Method Choice Reasoning
The response variable for the following models is an ordinal categorical variable. Thus, the error distribution is not expected to be normal, so I attempted to use generalized linear mixed models. However, given the small sample size of 56, if GLMMs cannot converge, I will compare a poisson and negative binomial GLMM to determine if the data is overdispersed. 

If the GLMMs can handle a smaller sample size, I suspect that treating riparian buffer as a random effect can account for unwanted (from a modeling perspective...) lower levels of invasion closer to the floodplain. In the case of the GLM, I will treat riparian buffer as an interaction term with distance from floodplain to account for the lack of signal when riparian buffer is present versus the negative correlation between distance from floodplain and overall plant invasion in the absence of a riparian buffer.

# Analysis

## load dependencies
```{r}
library(magrittr)
library(glmmTMB) %>% suppressWarnings()
library(MASS)
library(vegan)
```

## load data

Note: this data has previously been loaded and cleaned in python prior to the creation of the Multilayer Perceptron Classifier. After, I exported the cleaned dataframe from python to save time. The following chunk loads the exported dataframe as an object. Then, I drop some uninteresting columns that I do not want the model to consider as features. These columns include polygon ID, overall invasion by percent (I want the numeric value), and individual invasive species which I may analyze later... Finally, I created a binomial variable to determine whether the polygon is within 50 feet of the riparian buffer. I believe that this would be a more accurate determinant of the buffer's influence on plant invasion than a distance measurement of which the effect becomes redundant after a certain distance from the riparian buffer.

```{r}
df <- read.csv("surveyed_data.csv")
df <- df[,-c(3,4,5)]
#df$RB <- (df$Distance_Riparian_Buffer < 50) %>% as.numeric()
#df <- df[,-1] #drop Distance from Riparian Buffer
```
Note: after further examining the choice for random slope and random intercept of the GLMMs, Professor skelton and I determined that it would be better in this case to keep more levels of a categorical variable rather than my original idea, which was a binary representation of within riparian buffer zone versus out of riparian buffer zone. Since the polygons were drawn with respect to distance from floodplain, there are multiple levels of distance from riparian buffer (as the distance in ArcGIS pro was calculated based on distance from stream). 

Thus, each polygon will be assigned to one of four different levels with 0 representing polygons along the stream (most affected by riparian buffer), 1 representing polygons within 50 meters of the stream, 2 representing polygons within 150 meters of the stream, and finally polygons farther than 150 meters from the stream (likely unaffected by the riparian buffer)

```{r}
RB <- c() #create empty vector to append to
for (i in df$Distance_Riparian_Buffer){
  if(i == 0)
    RB <- c(RB, 0)
  if(i > 0 & i < 50)
    RB <- c(RB, 1)
  if(i > 50 & i < 150)
    RB <- c(RB, 2)
  if(i > 150)
    RB <- c(RB, 3)
}
df$RB <- RB
df <- df[,-1] #drop Distance from Riparian Buffer

```


## Data Preparation
Clearly, there is multicollinearity between the individual converted forest percentages and the overall converted forest percentage (a combination of all three year ranges). To simplify analyses and decrease the number of zeros within the data, I will remove all three individual converted forest percentages and only use the overall converted forest percentage.

```{r}
plot(df)
df <- df[,-c(4,5,6)]
```

## Model Specification


### compare variance structures

The response variable is not technically count data as level of invasion is an ordinal categorical variable, so I will fit a negative binomial glm. Then, I fit a glmm with a random slope and intercept for riparian buffer presence. All predictor variables will be included for each model with the interaction between distance from floodplain and RB.

```{r}
Mnb <- glm.nb(overall_numeric ~ Distance_Farmland +
          EAF +
          Dist_Floodplain +
          evergreen_forest +
          total_conversion +
          RB +
          Dist_Floodplain * RB,
          data = df)
M2 <- glmmTMB(overall_numeric ~ Distance_Farmland +
          EAF +
          evergreen_forest +
          (1|RB),
          data = df,
          family = nbinom2)
M3 <- glmmTMB(overall_numeric ~ Distance_Farmland +
          EAF +
          evergreen_forest +
          (Dist_Floodplain|RB),
          data = df,
          family = nbinom2)
```
Still running into a model convergence problem for the GLMM. Unfortunately... or fortunately? A GLMM may not be an option for this data with only 56 obeservations. Let's try a Poisson versus a negative binomial distribution variance structure instead.

```{r}
Mpois <- glm(overall_numeric ~ Distance_Farmland +
          EAF +
          Dist_Floodplain +
          evergreen_forest +
          total_conversion +
          RB +
          Dist_Floodplain * RB,
          data = df,
          family = "poisson")
```

```{r}
AIC(Mnb, Mpois)
```
Interesting! I did not expect the poisson model to be better because I was not working with count data. However, AIC suggests that a poisson variance structure may be better and that overdispersion is not present in the data.

## Model Selection

```{r}
summary(Mpois)
```


```{r}
drop1(Mpois, test = "Chisq")
```
The interaction between distance_floodplain and riparian buffer has the lowest likelihood, so remove the interaction

```{r}
M2 <- update(Mpois, .~. -(Dist_Floodplain:RB))
summary(M2)
```

```{r}
drop1(M2, test = "Chisq")
```

Distance_Floodplain does not improve the model based on the chisq test, so refit model without Dist_Floodplain. 
```{r}
M3 <- update(M2, .~. -Dist_Floodplain)
summary(M3)
```
```{r}
drop1(M3, test = "Chisq")
```
Distance_Farmland has the lowest likelihood, so remove it
```{r}
M4 <- update(M3, .~. -Distance_Farmland)
summary(M4)
```
```{r}
drop1(M4, test = "Chisq")
```
```{r}
M5 <- update(M4, .~. -RB)
summary(M5)
```

```{r}
M6 <- glm(overall_numeric ~ EAF + evergreen_forest + total_conversion + EAF * RB, 
    family = "poisson", data = df)
AIC(M5, M6)
```
test if an interaction between Elevation Above Floodplain and Riparian Buffer would improve the model. The AIC remains lower for the model without the interaction term. 

```{r}
drop1(M5, test = "Chisq")
```
remove EAF
```{r}
M7 <- update(M5, .~. -EAF)
summary(M7)
```
```{r}
drop1(M7, test = "Chisq")
```
remove total_conversion
```{r}
M8 <- update(M7, .~. -total_conversion)
summary(M8)
```

Unfortunately, after removing all insignificant variables using the drop1 method, all variables remain insigificant. I hypothesize that this is due to a small sample size as contemporary literature suggests that a strong and linear signal exists between variables like elevation above floodplain and overall plant invasion. Further, confounders like the Riparian Buffer (good for conservation but bad for my model) may have skewed the signal between distance/ elevation from floodplain and overall plant invasion. 


Now, I will attempt to examine another dimension of this resarch project (no pun intended).

#Part II: Individual Spp

Note: for my project pitch, I was not intending to include the collected data for individual species from the same research site... but then the following Tuesday we discussed multivariate analysis, which I thought could be interesting to apply to this highly dimensional data.

## Feasibility

This data includes cover class data for 21 individual species. The cover class for each individual species has a different scale than overall invasion: 1: < 1% of cover in polygon, 2: 1-5%, 3: 5-20%, 4: > 20%. 

## Scope 

This analysis can determine similarities and differences between invasive plant communities with the presence or absence of a riparian buffer.

Additionally, analysis could determine any "indicator" species that are useful in conservation to determine "good" areas (less invasion) or "bad" areas (more invasion). Many studies have pointed to a few species in Virginia, namely Microstegium Vimineum, as indicator species for overall invasion. It would be interesting to determine if my data supports or contradicts this claim.

## Data collection

The individual invasive species data were collected in the same 56 polygons previously mentioned, and invasive species were identified based on the most recent Virginia Invasive Plant List published by the Virginia DCR and were categorized by percent cover within each polygon. 

## Justification of method choice

As discussed in class, NMDS is great for determining relationships between species/features in ecological studies as it avoids the "double zero" problem (very much present in this data) unlike correlational analyses like PCA. Further, an example discussed in class used NMDS to compare bird communities in brushy hardwood versus open pineland.

Further, I may separately use PCA to determine any differences between geological predictors of invasion mentioned in Part I and dominant invaders like MIVI and CEOR as empirically, the presence of these invaders changed drastically in the field when walking away from farmland and streams.

## Crucial Variables

Multiple response variables (all 21 invaders observed) are of interest to determine any (invasive only) community-wide differences, and potential predictor variables of interest include Riparian Buffer and overall plant invasion.  

## re-read data
```{r}
df <- read.csv("surveyed_data.csv")
spp <- c()

# create a list that contains individual species for each polygon
for(i in df$individual){
  spp <- c(spp,(strsplit(i, ",")))
} 
```

# Tedious data cleaning 

Here, I loop through each row of the individual column of the dataframe (in the form of the created list) and extract information on the indivudal species listed there. I did this for each invasive species encountered in the data.

## MIVI
```{r}
MIVI <- c()

  spp.vec <- strsplit(i, split = "-") %>% unlist
  if("MIVI" %in% spp.vec){
    idx <- which(spp.vec == "MIVI")
    MIVI <- c(MIVI, spp.vec[idx + 1] %>% as.numeric())
  }
  else
    MIVI <- c(MIVI, 0)

    print(idx)
    LOJA <- c(LOJA, spp.vec[idx + 1] %>% as.numeric())

### make NA cover class 1

looks like this is a recording error too. Ligustrum Sinese (chinese privet) should be abbreviated as LISI rather than LISE... I will have to combine the two columns in the dataframe

# Multivariate Analysis

## get rid of unnecessary columns

I will get rid of the same three columns for individual species as I did for overall invasion.
```{r}
df <- df[,-c(3,4,5)]
df$RB <- (df$Distance_Riparian_Buffer < 50) %>% as.numeric()
```

 However, given the high dimensionality of this data, I will use all three year ranges for the converted forest instead of overall conversion like I did for overall invasion. Additionally, I will keep the previous response variable, overall_numeric, to see how each indivudal species influences and/or is influenced by overall invasion

```{r}
df <- df[,-c(1,10)] #drop Distance from Riparian Buffer and total conversion

```

## non-metric multi-dimensional scaling

```{r}
# for nmds, only use species as features
nmdf <- df[-c(1:8, 30)] 
```

### Scree plot
```{r}
#Use a for loop to try all values of k 1-8
#save stress values in vector called "strs" to make a "scree plot"
strs <- c()

for(i in 1:8){
  nm.i <- metaMDS(nmdf, k = i)
  strs[i] <- nm.i$stress
}

plot(1:8, strs, type = 'l', lwd = 2, 
     ylab = "stress", xlab = "number of dimensions",
     main = "Invasive Spp scree plot")
```

after looking at scree plot, it seems that the "elbow" is around 2 or 3. For simplicity of analysis and visualization, I'll stick with the default of 2.

### Visualize NMDS

```{r}
nm <- metaMDS(nmdf, noshare = T) #since my features are species, many of the default arguments in the metaMDS function (Bray-Curtis, k = 2, autotransform) are appropriate
```
#### Riparian Buffer Communities
```{r}

#### Indicator Species?

```{r}
# create vector of colors for each level of overall invasion
clr <- vector(length = nrow(nmdf))
  clr[which(df$overall_numeric == 2)] = "green"
  clr[which(df$overall_numeric == 3)] = "yellow"
  clr[which(df$overall_numeric == 4)] = "orange"
  clr[which(df$overall_numeric == 5)] = "red"
#plot site scores
plot(nm$points, pch = 21, bg = clr, 
cex = 1.5, main = "NMDS of Invasive Species Data, k = 2",
ylab = "NMDS2", xlab = "NMDS1",
ylim = c(-1,1), xlim = c(-1,1))

abline(h = 0, lty = 3, lwd = 2, col = "grey85")
abline(v = 0, lty = 3, lwd = 2, col = "grey85")

#add text for species scores
text(nm$species, lab = names(nmdf) )

legend("bottomright", legend = 5:2,
       pch = 21, pt.bg = c("red","orange","yellow", "green"))

## principal component analysis
```{r}
#scale function scales all variables and center on zero
# columns selected include all geological/environmental variables + overall invasion
pc <- princomp(scale(df[,c(1:8, 30)], center = TRUE)) 

```

### MIVI

```{r}
#make a vector of colors that correspond to the different species

clr <- vector(length = length(df$MIVI.Length))
  clr[which(df$MIVI == 4)] = "red" #high MIVI invasion
  clr[which(df$MIVI == 3)] = "orange" 
  clr[which(df$MIVI == 2)] = "yellow" 
  clr[which(df$MIVI == 1)] = "green" 
  clr[which(df$MIVI == 0)] = "grey" 

  
#plot it
  
plot(pc$scores[,1:2], type = "n", main = "level of invasion for MIVI")
points(pc$scores[,1:2], pch = 21, bg = clr, cex = 1.5)
legend("bottomright", legend = 4:0,
       pch = 21, pt.bg = c("red","orange","yellow", "green", "grey"), pt.cex = 1.5)

```

I feel like just PC1 might explain and show this relationship even better... (mostly elevation above floodplain)

```{r}
stripchart(pc$scores[,1], 
           main = "level of invasion for MIVI",
           pch = 21, 
           bg = clr,
           method = "jitter",
           xlab = "PC 1",
           cex = 1.2
           )
legend("topleft", 
       legend = 4:0,
       pch = 21,
       pt.bg = c("red","orange","yellow", "green", "grey"),
       horiz = T)
```


### analyze difference in level of invasion for 2 common invaders

Beginning with Microstegium Vimineum and Celastrus Orbiculatis.
```{r}
#make a vector of colors that correspond to the different species

clr <- vector(length = length(df$MIVI.Length))
  clr[which(df$MIVI >= 3 & df$CEOR < 3)] = "red" #high MIVI invasion
  clr[which(df$MIVI >= 3 & df$CEOR >= 3)] = "purple" #high invasion for both
  clr[which(df$MIVI < 3 & df$CEOR >= 3)] = "blue" # high CEOR invasion
  clr[which(df$MIVI < 3 & df$CEOR < 3)] = "green" #low invasion for both
  
#plot it
  
plot(pc$scores[,1:2], type = "n", main = "level of invasion for MIVI and CEOR")
points(pc$scores[,1:2], pch = 21, bg = clr, cex = 1.5)
legend("bottomright", legend = c("high MIVI","high both","high CEOR", "low both"),
       pch = 21, pt.bg = c("red","purple","blue", "green"), pt.cex = 1.5)

```

### CEOR

```{r}
#make a vector of colors that correspond to the different species

clr <- vector(length = length(df$MIVI.Length))
  clr[which(df$CEOR == 4)] = "red" #high MIVI invasion
  clr[which(df$CEOR == 3)] = "orange" 
  clr[which(df$CEOR == 2)] = "yellow" 
  clr[which(df$CEOR == 1)] = "green" 
  clr[which(df$CEOR == 0)] = "grey" 

  
#plot it
  
plot(pc$scores[,1:2], type = "n", main = "level of invasion for CEOR")
points(pc$scores[,1:2], pch = 21, bg = clr, cex = 1.5)
legend("bottomright", legend = 4:0,
       pch = 21, pt.bg = c("red","orange","yellow", "green", "grey"), pt.cex = 1.5)
